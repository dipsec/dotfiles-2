Issues
------
- Flash (misalignment when fullscreened) (https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=128169)
- No expose
- No 'show desktop'
- can't turn off keyboard backlighting (not that that's AWM's fault)
- Modify the AWM theme itself - especially re: menus
- Num-lock is off by default. This is weird.
- I don't think the 'run_once' is truly allowing programs to only run once

Misc. Todo
----------
- Should color-coordinate AWM, Vim, and desktop background to be uber-1337
- Fix the plug computers
- Restore some of the old useful keyboard shortcuts (maybe)
- blog about moving in to AWM
